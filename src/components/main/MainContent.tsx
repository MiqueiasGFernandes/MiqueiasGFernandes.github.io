              <p><b>I am a Nuke Compositor and Motion Designer</b> with a passion for bringing fantasy to life. I just started Nuke Compositing and I am excited to showcase my skills with my first Nuke demo reel. With a background in motion design, I spent over 2 years creating social media ads. I have learned to <b>overcome obstacles</b> and work with great attention to detail.</p>

              <p>My creative process is all about bringing my ideas to life. I draw inspiration from everything that surrounds me, whether itâ€™s the latest blockbuster or the view out my window. As a Nuke Compositor, I am ready to <b>take on the world</b> and make a name for myself in the industry.</p>

              <p>As a kid, I discovered my passion for visual effects by playing around with Adobe After Effects (thanks Andrew Kramer) and creating videos for school projects or just for fun with friends. Now, as a Nuke Compositor. <b>I am looking forward to bringing that same passion into my work.</b></p>

              <p>When i am not working on visual effects and motion design projects, I like to do some cool personal stuff. I have a passion for music and enjoy playing jazz, especially on the piano. I like to keep up with the latest technological developments. I am also a Christian and support my local church. I value the importante of community and personal growth in all aspects of my life.</p>

              <p>I look forward to the new challenges and experiences ahead, and i have high expectations for what < b > we can accomplish</b> in the future.</p>
